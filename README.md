# Guess-the-word (ID asg 2)

Our project is about a word game. The letters of the word would be mixed up and the user would have to umscramble the letters to form the word. 


# Design Process
Provide us insights about your design process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.



# Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

  Start game button: When entering the page a start game button can be seen. Once the user presses the start button, the game starts by showing the scrambled word.
  
  timer: the countdown starts once the page is loaded. Users would have to solve as many words as possible within the time limit (1 minute). After the time is up, the game is over
  
  score: There is a scoring system for the game. Each time the user gets a word correct, the score is updated

input bar: allows the user to type their guesses 



additional features to be implemented in the future: better scoring system,leaderboard, more variety of words, difficulty level

# Features Left to Implement
Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

# Input validation 
If the user does not type anything or make a wrong guess in the input bar, there will be a message displayed, saying that there has been an incorrect guess made. The user will then be asked to try again. 

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

We received inspiration from the app called Wordscapes and a game called Wordle. As the popularity of wordle is rising, we decided to do a game that is similar to wordle and related to word plays
